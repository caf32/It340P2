	// services at once.

	sudo tasksel

	// Selected LAMP and set passwords for databasses

Allowed FTP user to change website.
	
	// In order to do this I tried different things regurading permitions and changing home folders. unfortinately this lead to many permission problmes. I resolved this issue by creating symbolic link inside a folder in the ftpuser03 directory

	// Create a folder inside the ftpuser03 home folder 
	mk public_html

	// create symbolic link
	// This had to be performed under root, sudo users did not work
